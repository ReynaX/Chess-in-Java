# Chess in Java

Chess is an application to play a two-player Chess game and play with (very stupid for now) a computer. The game
contains all those rules:

* Movement of pieces
* Checkmate
* Stalemate (caused by inability of moves or insufficient materials)
* Castling
* Promotion (only to Queen)
* 50-moves rule
* En passant
* Saving the game state in PNG

I've made this project to learn Java, get an assignment in the college and hopefully increase my future chances of
getting a job. The project needs a lot of polishing like making the better and faster calculations of computer moves,
getting rid of bugs with GUI/layouts, and rewriting code to make it cleaner.

## Technology

The project is fully coded in Java and Java Swing GUI.
